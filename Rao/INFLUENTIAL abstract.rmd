# Methods

- For purposes of finding the first and last date of screening by site and season, the range of possible screening dates was set as August 1 - June 1
- `r num_excluded` hospitalizations with admission date before the first date of screening for the season or with discharge dates after the last date of screening for the season were excluded from analysis
- 11,472 of 78,832 patients had more than one hospitalization. The unit of analysis was hospitalization.

# Questions

1) Since we don't have DOB, it is OK to estimate whether patients are at least 6 months of age using age of 6 * 30 = 180 days?
2) The exclusion criterion states that patients must not be discharged from the ICU. Is it possible someone could be in the ICU at the start of the admission but not discharged from there? If we exclude all records with ICU = 1, ~19k hospitalizations will be excluded
3) Just to confirm: no corresponding variable to check ward of state, foster child, death on record, or flagged as does not wish to participate in research
4) There are a lot of missing values for contraindication and previous vaccine questions. If these were left blank, I assumed there was no contraindication or prior vaccine.
